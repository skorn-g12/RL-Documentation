I'll try to accumulate some links that I found to be quite useful. This is still a *TO DO* : )


Multi-armed Bandit
==================

`TowardsDataScience <https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-armed-bandits-and-reinforcement-learning-dc9001dcb8da>`_ 

The above link has a good explanation of epsilon-greedy as well.


Markov Decision Processes
==================

`SpiceWorks <https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-markov-decision-process/>`_ 


Dynamic Programming
==================
It is exactly what you think. Reusing earlier results to compute new results.


Monte Carlo
==================
It is a fancy way of saying "compute the average"

TD Learning
==================
`TowardsDataScience <https://towardsdatascience.com/temporal-difference-learning-47b4a7205ca8>`_ 

Approximation Methods
==================

`TowardsDataScience <https://towardsdatascience.com/function-approximation-in-reinforcement-learning-85a4864d566#:~:text=In%20summary%20the%20function%20approximation,computation%20time%20and%20memory%20space.>`_
